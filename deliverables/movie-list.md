# movie list application

Using [this](component-based-design/deliverables/film.json) Data, create React app that allows the users to get detailed information over the movies from the movie data.

you can take a look here for [inspiration](https://react-query-movies-app.netlify.app/)

## Setup

- use`create-react-app` to create a React application. Give it the name `movies`(or any)
- Copy and paste the provided data inside the src folder of your new project

## Phases

This project uses concepts from the first few chapters in this module, breaking the project into 3 phases will help you master each concept before moving on:

1. **Render the Movies**: Render the complete list of movies with no user interactions. Just a pretty page full of movie thumbnails.
2. **Filter the Movies**: Add a text input field so users can filter the movies in realtime.
3. **Movie Details**: A user can click on any movie thumbnail to learn more about that film. (they can also go back to the main page!)

## Checklists

This is a project for small groups from 2-3 people, here's a checklist for your `deliverable` issue:

```markdown
<!-- replace the _ with the correct user name and repo -->

- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_)
- [ ] [many small, well-named commits per component](https://github.com/_/_/commits)
- [ ] a nice README
- [pull requests](https://github.com/_/_/pulls)
  - [ ] code review checklist is complete (write your own check list!)
  - [ ] the reviewer merged the code
```
